# Katas from Code Wars

Solutions to [CodeWars][codewars] functional programming katas in JavaScript. See the [full list][codewars-chals] (must have an account).

Add your solution code to subdirectories with the format `kata-name/solution.js`. An example is provided at `functional-sql/solution.js`.

If you want to write tests, you can use `chai` and `mocha`. These libraries are already a part of the dependencies (see the `package.json` file at root). To make sure that `npm test` picks up your test files, just make sure your test files end in `_spec.js`, for example `functional-sql_spec.js`.
